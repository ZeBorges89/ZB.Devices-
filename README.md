# ZB.Devices-
A set of max for live devices for cool ambient stuff. 
ZB.Freeze- A simple FFT audio Freezer
ZB.Grains- Cuts incoming signal into audio segments using chucker~, also giving the option to scramble the segments randomly and reverse them, making a "real-time" granulation effect. 
ZB.4LayerFreezer- A four layer audio freezer, allowing control over individual layers. 
ZB.SingleFreezer- Similar logic but only without four faders and an option to overdub frozen layers. 
ZB.textureSynth- An experimental approach to vector synthesis between various types of sound sytnhesizing methods, karplus strong, additive synthesis and bi-dimensional wavetable synthesis with spectral transposition. 
ZB.MetricKiller- A killswitch that interrupts signal synchronized with live's transport. 
Feel free to explore the patches and reverse engineer them. For any parts of the patch you decide to copy, please give me some credit. Thank you and have fun.
